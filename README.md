# WEB150-Final-Project
This is the final project for my WEB150 class; a complete redesign of a local restaurant's webpage. Modularly Written and Fully Responsive. As of now it stands completed. It isn't perfect (and there are definitely some revisions I might take on), but for now I'm ready to move forward on other projects, such as learning VueJS.

Note: This site uses modular CSS per class requirements. IRL I would use Gulp to Concatenate my CSS together and minify that file to a production file first.
