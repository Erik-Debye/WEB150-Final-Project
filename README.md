# WEB150-Final-Project
This is the final project for my WEB150 class; a complete redesign of a local restaurant's webpage. Modularly Written and Fully Responsive. A work in progress (expected completion ~5/17/22)

Note: This site uses modular CSS per class requirements. IRL I would use WebPack to Concatenate my CSS together and minify that file to a production file first.
